#  Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to theplaceyoung's Profile! âœ¨ 

Hello! I'm SoYoung Jang, a passionate programming and analyzing with interests in DX/DT(Digital Transformation) and AI(Artificial Intelligence). 
Explore my GitHub repositories to see what I've been working on.

ðŸ”­ I'm currently dedicating my time to personal projects. Specifically, I'm actively engaged in the development of an image recognition system using YOLO (You Only Look Once) technology. I'm also concurrently working on a personal management app using Flutter.

ðŸŒ± As part of the learning process, I'm exploring the depths of Flutter for app development and continually improving my skills in image recognition technologies.

ðŸ‘¯ I'm open to collaboration with fellow developers who share an interest in Flutter or image recognition. If you have any exciting ideas or want to contribute to the projects, let's collaborate!

ðŸ¤” While working on these projects, I am open to receiving any help, advice, or suggestions that can enhance the quality and functionality of the image recognition system and personal management app.

ðŸ’¬ Feel free to reach out if you have any questions related to Flutter, image recognition, or if you want to discuss potential collaboration opportunities.

ðŸ“« You can contact me through your preferred method or your GitHub profile.

ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/Her

âš¡ Fun fact: Despite being engaged in self-driven projects currently, I'm curious to learn how others manage personal and professional tasks, which might inspire future enhancements in my personal management app.
